 * User Story: As a trader I want to be able to monitor stock prices such

 *
 * Connects to a PriceSource instance
 * Monitors price movements on a specified single stock (e.g. "IBM")
 * Executes a single "buy" instruction for a specified number of lots (e.g. 100) as soon as the price of that stock is seen to be below a specified price (e.g. 55.0). Donâ€™t worry what units that is in.
